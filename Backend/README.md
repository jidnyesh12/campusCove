## File Uploads

The backend uses Multer for handling file uploads and Cloudinary for storing images:

1. Multer temporarily stores uploaded files in the `/uploads` directory
2. Files are then uploaded to Cloudinary
3. Cloudinary URLs are stored in the database
4. Temporary files are deleted after processing

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables (see `.env.example`):

```
# MongoDB Connection
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

# Cloudinary Configuration
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Frontend URLs for CORS
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://campus-cove.vercel.app,https://campus-cove-ten.vercel.app

# Port
PORT=5000
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file with the required environment variables
4. Start the development server:
   ```
